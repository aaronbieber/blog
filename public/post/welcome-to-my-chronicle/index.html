    <p>I’ll try to keep this brief. Five years ago, I left my job as a production PHP
programmer at a national consulting firm (business consulting, not development
consulting) to take a job writing ColdFusion at a startup on the other side of
the state.</p>
<p>Since then, I have learned the ins and outs of an arcane version of ColdFusion
while using more modern languages, such as Ruby and Python, only in my spare
time. Finally, after all these years, the business sees fit to undertake a
rewrite and to leave ColdFusion behind. After much deliberation, PHP was
chosen.</p>
<p>Let us keep the snickers to a minimum; PHP is still the language with the
broadest adoption and is therefore among the easiest to hire for. As it turns
out, a lot has changed in PHP since I left my previous position.</p>
<p>This blog will be a chronicle of my discoveries, solutions to odd problems,
and probably also an outpouring of affection for Vim, my favorite editor.</p>
