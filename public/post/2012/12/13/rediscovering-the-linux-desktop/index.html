    <p>Here at the day job, we are slowly moving our (production) systems away from
Windows and toward (Ubuntu LTS) Linux. The company has always been
Windows-oriented, mostly due to the decisions of its President when it was
founded, subsequent inertia, and the skillsets of the infrastructure teams.
Now, though, we have an increased Linux knowledgebase in-house, we’ve started
this reorientation toward PHP and other open-source products, and Linux just
makes more sense.<del>MORE</del></p>
<p>To help “grease the wheels” in the development process, we started toying with
Vagrant and Chef to spin up local development instances, which has been a
really interesting and satisfying endeavor. This whole Vagrant/VirtualBox
thing is opening up new ideas about how to develop efficiently and about the
malleability of server configurations that we’d never have considered up till
now.</p>
<p>I even started to use Vagrant myself, for freelance projects, which I found to
be gratifying. Gone are the days of guarding your VMware image with a
pitchfork against the specter of data loss or corruption; with only your
Vagrantfile in hand (and at least knowing which base image you used, which is
important only to a point), you can spin up a replica of the system in
moments.</p>
<p>But this isn’t meant to be a 500-word essay on how great Vagrant is. Dipping
back into the Linux world made me yearn for some of the things that Windows
(no offense to Cygwin) just can’t do. For example, I really love tmux, the
terminal multiplexer. I have finally left GNU screen behind on my Mac, but
alas, tmux doesn’t run in Cygwin because of the way the signals are passed
through pipes or sockets or something that Cygwin can’t do.</p>
<p>This is a shame, because tmux increases my productivity, and I want my
productivity to increase. So what to do? The obvious answer (to me, anyway)
was to dust off this copy of VMware Workstation that they got for me and just
run Ubuntu as an actual desktop. With a GUI. Give it the old college try once
again. So I did that.</p>
<p>After running a large terminal window with tmux in it and feeling the joy of
Firefox and Google Chrome acting, essentially, identically to how they do in
Windows, and apt-getting basically the whole world at once, a thought came to
me.</p>
<p>Window managers. Remember window managers?</p>
<p>If you’re reading this in Linux, the chances are pretty high that you fall
into one of two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re using Gnome or KDE as your default window manager because it was
installed with your distribution (like Ubuntu), or</li>
<li>You’re using your own window manager because hot damn there are so many to
choose from.</li>
</ul>
<p>What the hell is a window manager, you might be asking, if you are a member of
the former group? A window manager is a piece of software that manages your
windows; their locations, sizes, behaviors, and so forth. Every GUI OS has
some kind of a window manager, but it so happens that in Linux (as with most
things in Linux), the window manager is not actually inextricably tied to the
desktop or the launcher bar (“taskbar,” if you will), or any other aspect of
the GUI experience.</p>
<p>Everything is separated out. Separation of responsibility. Like a good,
organized OS should be.</p>
<p>So, which window manager to choose? I decided to give xmonad a try. Xmonad is
a window manager written in Haskell that tiles your windows automatically.
Windows can’t float (unless you force them to), and they self-organize using
predefined patterns, which you can change. You also get virtual desktops as
well, so you can have several screens of tiled windows and switch between them
quickly.</p>
<p>So far, this is the best computing experience I’ve probably ever had.
Everything is at my fingertips; I barely use the mouse. Xmonad is so fast,
even in this virtual machine running inside of my Windows 7 desktop. I
borrowed some configuration from folks on the Googlewebs to get things pointed
in the right direction, but it was really not too hard to set up.</p>
<p>Here are some references:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.vicfryzel.com/2010/06/27/obtaining-a-beautiful-usable-xmonad-configuration">Obtaining a beautiful, usable xmonad configuration</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.huntlycameron.co.uk/2010/11/how-to-set-up-xmonad-xmobar-ubuntu/">How-to: Set up XMonad &amp; XMobar on Ubuntu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I lifted most of the config from those guys and followed their instructions.</p>
<p>I also wanted to do more in terminal windows, because terminals are badass,
and when you’re doing everything with the keyboard you really don’t want to
fiddle with GUI widgets (except for web browsing, and for that there’s Chrome
Vimium, of course).</p>
<ul>
<li>For the tweeting: TTYtter (so cool!)</li>
<li>For Gtalk: IRSSI &amp; the irssi-xmpp plugin (the most stable console XMPP
client I have tried!)</li>
<li>For music: cmus (really nice once you figure out how it works. RTFM.)</li>
</ul>
