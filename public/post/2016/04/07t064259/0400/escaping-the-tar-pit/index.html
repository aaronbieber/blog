    <p>If you don't know by now, I'm sort of a personal efficiency maven. I don't like
to waste keystrokes, I'm always experimenting with different key bindings and
shortcuts, and I feel almost personally offended when I see someone reach for
their mouse to click a button that I know has a keyboard equivalent.</p>
<p>But this isn't about my pet peeves; this is about tuning yourself in to the
improvements you can make on a daily basis that will increase your lifetime
efficiency dramatically.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to give a &ldquo;lightning talk&rdquo; at the Boston PHP meetup, so I
spoke on this topic. It went OK, so I gave it again at Wayfair and I let them
record it. The recording quality is not the best, but I think the point comes
across just fine.</p>
<p>The talk is called &ldquo;Escaping the Tar Pit: Principles of Continuous Improvement.&rdquo;
Video and full slides after the break.<del>MORE</del></p>

<p>You can <a href="http://aaronbieber.com/www/escaping-the-tar-pit/#/">view the whole slide deck here</a>, and as always, please share any
