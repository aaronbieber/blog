    <p>I love git. A lot.</p>
<p>Judging by the growing ubiquity of github.com in nearly every corner of
digital life that can be captured in text form, I have concluded that I am not
alone in this sentiment. So much do I love git and github.com that I have
taken to using it for as much as possible.</p>
<p>My latest thing is dotfiles. You know all of those preference and settings
files that start to pile up in your Mac or Linux home directory? The ones that
start with a period? For a while I had been keeping the longer, more important
ones on github.com, which is really helpful when using a new computer or
reinstalling your OS from scratch.</p>
<p>Today, though, I took it to the next level. Want to know more?<del>MORE</del></p>
<p>Maybe this isn't an Earth-shattering, life-changing revelation, but it
occurred to me that every time I clone this repository I wind up copying out
the files I want and then sort of forgetting about it, neglecting it, and
letting the various files on different computers fall out of sync.</p>
<p>I don't like things to get neglected and I don't like it when things are out
of sync. I have been storing my whole Vim configuration in a git repository
for a long time and now I could never give that up. It's too easy to pull the
changes that I made into a different environment or to set up Vim on a new
computer (or server).</p>
<p>Actually, the only dotfiles I store so far are:</p>
<pre><code>.bashrc
.gitconfig
.screenrc
.tmux.conf
.ttytterrc
</code></pre><p>And even among those, <code>.screenrc</code> is sort of redundant because I now use tmux
almost everywhere. That said, I wanted to build up a storage and installation
system for dotfiles that I could use anywhere&hellip; So I did.</p>
<p>You can see the repository for yourself in its entirety <a href="http://github.com/aaronbieber/dotfiles">on github.com</a>,
but the really magical part is this little bash script called <code>linkall</code>.</p>
<p>It's so short, I'll show you the whole thing right here:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>All it does is scan the directory it lives in for files starting with a period
(it skips directories right now because I don't store any in my dotfiles repo
except for the <code>.git</code> repository metadata directory itself, which should not
be linked to from elsewhere) and creates symbolic links to them from the
running user's home directory.</p>
<p>In short, a file like <code>.bashrc</code> stored alongside <code>linkall</code> gets a symlink
created called <code>~/.bashrc</code>. Additionally, to be safe, it will not overwrite
existing files or symlinks and will instead print &ldquo;Failed&rdquo; for that file. If
you are sure you want to wipe them out and replace them, just pass <code>-f</code> to the
script.</p>
<p>{% infobox %}
There is only a small amount of bash-fu in this one; feel free to drop me a
comment below if you'd like me to explain how any of this actually works.
{% endinfobox %}</p>
<p>How cool is that? So now, on a new system, and assuming that git is installed,
setting up all of my preferences is as simple as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ git clone git@github.com:aaronbieber/dotfiles
$ dotfiles/linkall
</code></pre></div><p>Now, when I want to make changes to my <code>.tmux.conf</code>, for example, I don't have
to remember to copy anything. <code>vim ~/.tmux.conf</code> will edit the file in the
repository so that I can later push it up and receive those changes on my
other machines.</p>
<p>How cool is that?</p>
