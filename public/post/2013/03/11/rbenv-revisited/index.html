    <p>A few days ago I wrote about my
<a href="/blog/2013/03/08/rbenv-for-the-win/">experience with Rbenv</a>, the Ruby
environment manager (is that what they call it?). My overall experience was
good, but I did encounter a couple of hiccups getting the &ldquo;ruby-build&rdquo; plugin
to work. While installing the whole kit once again on this cute new Ubuntu
laptop, I figured it out.<del>MORE</del></p>
<p>I shouldn't have been so audacious as to try to install Rbenv using <code>apt</code>
because, naturally, it isn't the latest version. When you run the <code>rbenv</code>
command, it actually executes a bash script that hands off to the program that
handles whichever command you are running. In other words, when you run <code>rbenv  versions</code>, it hands off to <code>rbenv-versions</code>, if it exists in your path.</p>
<p>It's that &ldquo;bootstrapping&rdquo; bash script that is responsible for making sure that
all of the necessary paths are searched for the program in question. The
latest version (from github) actually looks through the <code>~/.rbenv/plugins</code>
directory. The version from <code>apt</code> does not.</p>
<p>Serves me right. Fortunately, fixing it is easy:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo apt-get remove rbenv
$ rm -rf ~/.rbenv
$ git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
$ git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git 
~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
</code></pre></div><p>That's pretty much it. Remember to add the path stuff to your <code>~/.profile</code> or
<code>~/.bashrc</code> or whatever. I share my shell configurations across several
machines, not all of which use Rbenv, so I came up with this, which works
nicely:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#f92672">[</span> -d $HOME/.rbenv/bin <span style="color:#f92672">]</span>; <span style="color:#66d9ef">then</span> export PATH<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH; <span style="color:#66d9ef">fi</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> which rbenv &gt; /dev/null; <span style="color:#66d9ef">then</span> eval <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>rbenv init -<span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>; <span style="color:#66d9ef">fi</span>
</code></pre></div><p>That will only change your path and import the Rbenv initialization settings
if Rbenv actually exists. Harmony.</p>
<p>The next problem that I had was that Ruby had no OpenSSL support and refused
to let bundler run. Ruby needs to be compiled with OpenSSL support, but I had
built it using &ldquo;ruby-build,&rdquo; which takes no options (and generally doesn't
need to). Oddly it worked fine on the Ubuntu VM where I did this last time.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, this laptop didn't have <code>openssl</code> nor <code>libssl-dev</code>
installed. The thing is, if you don't have <code>libssl-dev</code>, ruby won't be able to
compile its built-in OpenSSL stuff, but it won't tell you this. Or, at least,
it won't fail to build, and since <code>ruby-build</code> gobbles up all of the output of
the build process, you probably won't know.</p>
<p>So the moral of the story is, on a virgin box, install <code>openssl</code> and
<code>libssl-dev</code> before running your <code>rbenv install</code> stuff.</p>
