            <p>I've become somewhat more of an Emacs celebrity than I could have predicted. After giving that talk and spending a couple years blogging and tweeting about Emacs, people frequently ask for my opinion or advice regarding its use, how to learn it, or whether to learn it at all.
Today I want to share my long-form answer to a few related questions that I get asked pretty often. Those questions are, roughly:</p>

As the first quarter of the year reaches its end, my department is deep into planning the work we will do in the second quarter. As you all know, I use Org Mode to sort out all of the details of my work life, including imminent tasks, meetings I need to schedule, and projects I want to work on.
For the last three months I've kept notes for all of the projects that my team could possibly put effort toward, as I thought of them.</p>

            <p>If you are a terminal guy as I am, or if you're a terminal gal, you may be inclined to use Emacs in the terminal as well. A couple of my friends who took up Vim got used to running it within tmux and exchanged one terminal program for the other. This is wrong.
The GUI Emacs program is not just a crutch for the ignorant fools with their fingers all gnarled by mouse overuse; no, GUI Emacs is much more powerful, and there is almost no reason at all to run Emacs in a terminal.</p>

            <p>I'm going to show you how you can create a &ldquo;bookmarklet&rdquo; button in your browser that will capture a note or link directly into Org Mode in your running Emacs. That's right, you press a button in, say, Chrome, and Emacs pops up and displays your Org capture interface with the current webpage's information in it.

            <p>Hopefully you already know that you can insert common markup blocks in Org Mode by entering a prefix like &lt;s and pressing &lt;M-TAB&gt;. Org Mode publicly calls these &ldquo;Easy Templates&rdquo; but internally calls them &ldquo;structure templates.&rdquo; I wanted to be able to insert a couple of other common Org-specific blocks, so I figured out how to add my own. MORE
Org Mode supports a few &ldquo;blocks,&rdquo; which you can read about beginning on the Blocks page of the Org documentation.</p>

            <p>Now that you have read [An Agenda for Life with Org Mode][agenda-4l], you know how to build the perfect agenda for managing the tasks in your life. But, I ask you, what good is a task that you cannot complete?
[agenda-4l]: {% post_url 2016-09-24-an-agenda-for-life-with-org-mode %})
Fortunately, Org Mode provides a rich set of interactive commands for manipulating your task entries directly from the agenda view and, in fine Emacs style, the commands relevant to each type of view will apply only to the appropriate section of a composite view.</p>

            <p>I've been promising the Twitterverse that I would write more about how I use Org Mode to get stuff done and how I use it to be a better manager. Upon careful reflection, there is too much to cover in just one post, so this is the first of what will likely be several posts on these topics.
Today I would like to focus on the &ldquo;agenda view&rdquo; and how I've configured it to give me a window into what I need to do now, what is on the horizon, and manage which things I should do first.</p>

            <p>As you certainly know by now, I was an outspoken and enthusiastic Vim user for about 15 years. During that time, I tried Emacs a couple of times, but it didn't really stick until last year. One of the reasons Emacs makes me so happy is its Lisp-based extension language (Emacs Lisp, or just Elisp for short).
I do not have a formal background in computer science, so I never had the experience of being forced to do exercises in Scheme or Lisp; Elisp is the first (and only) Lisp I've ever learned.</p>

            <p>I'm an opinionated software engineer. I have strongly held beliefs about what makes a program good or bad (as I imagine most programmers do) but as a Vim user for 15 years who changed camps to Emacs, I'm on the front lines of a turf war that shows no signs of calming.
I believe strongly that &ldquo;good software&rdquo; is that which is fit for its intended purpose, and that has both benevolent maintainership and a strong community.</p>

            <p>In my previous post, [Playing Tag in Org Mode][tag], I talked about leveraging Org Mode's powerful tag system to help you find the notes or references you're looking for.
Since then, I've refined my use of tags and begun making better use of Org Mode's custom ID abilities. In this post, I'll share the new navigation code I've written and show you how you can use custom IDs to link or jump directly to a specific item in your notes.</p>
