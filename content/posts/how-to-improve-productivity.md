Let's say you want your workers to be more productive. As the leader of a large
and complex organization, there are numerous levers that you could pull... But
which ones will improve the work output?

As it turns out, the answer is none of them. Or all of them.

Worker productivity has always been of interest. It is self-evident that if you
can get employees to produce more by changing some simple parameters of the work
environment, that is "free money" in effect.

Not only was productivity of interest to business owners, but also the National
Research Council (which is part of the National Academies of Science,
Engineering, and Medicine). So, they designed an experiment.

I'll let the amazing historian and presenter James Burke explain it, excerpted
from his BBC show "Connections."

> OK, here's what you're trying to do: find out what you have to do to get
> workers to produce more.
>
> So you explain carefully that you're going to try upping the light levels.
>
> Production goes up.
>
> Then you explain carefully, you're going to lower the light levels.
>
> Production *stays* up!
>
> So you explain carefully you're going to change everything at random: the
> heat, the working day, the length of the lunch break, rest periods; you do
> that for five years... And production goes up again!
>
> Then you explain carefully, you're going to put everything back where it was.
>
> Production *stays up!*
>
> Then you get the point... *Explaining carefully* made workers happy and more
> productive!

These experiments took place at the Western Electric Hawthorne Plant in Cicero,
Illinois in the 1920s and '30s. You can easily look this up and read all about
them (much has been written).

Although the experiments resulted in spurious conclusions that have been
discredited by some (the so-called "Hawthorne effect"), what psychologists and
sociologists all seem to agree on is that people perform better with feedback
(the more specific and immediate the better), and when they are seen and heard.

So, if you want your people to be happier and work harder: listen to them, and
talk to them.

The more you hear their concerns, observe their challenges, and explain exactly
why everything is happening and why it matters, the more productive everyone
will be.
