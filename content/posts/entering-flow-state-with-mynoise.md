I want to tell you about the "ultimate noise (masking) machine,"
[myNoise](https://mynoise.net). myNoise is a website and mobile app that allows you to explore
customizable soundscapes that can help you get in the zone, change your
emotional state, manage tinnitus, and more.

In this post, I'll explain what myNoise is, how it works, make some
recommendations for sound environments to try, and share a couple of tips and
tricks I've developed.

Chances are good that if you're one of my readers, you work on a computer all
day. Maybe you're a programmer or maybe you're an engineering manager, but either
way you spend a lot of your time getting into (or trying to get into) a "flow
state."

> In positive psychology, a **flow state**, also known colloquially as being **in the zone**, is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.

Most people have trouble getting into a flow state with creative or problem
solving work (like writing or programming) without the right auditory
conditions. The majority of people solve that problem with music, which is
completely valid, but there is an alternative: myNoise.

## What is myNoise?

Perhaps oddly named, and certainly quirky in its own ways, myNoise is a website
where you can browse hundreds of sound "generators" that each create a
customizable auditory atmosphere.

What makes myNoise remarkable is its customization capabilities, but what makes
it valuable is the quality and breadth of sound environments
available. Everything from natural sounds like waterfalls or tropical
rainforests, to fictional environments like "medieval library" or "RPG village"
(one of my favorites).

Depending on your task at hand and your state of mind, you might like to
enter---through sound---a busy cafe, with the indistinct chatter of patrons and
the clinking of dishware; or, perhaps you'd prefer an imaginary alchemist's lab,
with its bubbling experiments, hissing bellows, the soft writing on a
chalkboard, and the subtle ticking of an old mechanical clock.

At other times, perhaps a walk in a pasture, or a Japanese garden, or through a deep forest may strike the right mood for you.

Each of these sound environments can be adjusted to your taste. Love the
alchemist's lab but find yourself too distracted by the hissing bellows? You can
turn down the volume of just that one element, shaping the soundscape to your
precise specifications.

## Customization

The real power of myNoise comes from its interactive features.


 - "Audio wallpaper"; a way to fill a void so that thought can take place

 - Better than music because it doesn't have a fixed rise/fall, never has distracting lyrics, never has unexpected crescendos (sometimes you want these, but not always)

 - Totally endless, no noticeable loop, no changes in timbre etc.

 - Introduce Dr. Ir. S. Pigeon & mynoise.net

 - Describe the "generator" system

   - Specifically discuss the "animation" feature

 - Favorite example links?

 - Favorite way to listen, usually, is randomly adding and removing sound elements over time, producing a flowing, continuously morphing experience. Built-in feature is called "MiniMax."

 - Finally share "MiniMax All" bookmarklet.
