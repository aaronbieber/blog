 - Experiments can deliver unexpected results
 
 - Experiments can disprove hypotheses
 
 - The only failed experiment is one that you don't learn from
 
> Experiment - When you want to try something but you’re worried about failing,
> call it an experiment. Experimentation is the freedom to take risks and do the
> scary things that may not pan out. There’s no way to fail at an experiment
> because the only failed experiment is the one that you don’t learn from. So
> document it somewhere with a start/end date and a measurable hypothesis, and
> then run the experiment.

> The only failed experiment is the one that doesn't teach you anything.
