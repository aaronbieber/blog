title: "Google's Broken Fix for Broken Phones"

I've been a fairly enthusiastic Google Pixel owner since the beginning, in spite
of the Pixel line's drunkenly stumbling feature roadmap that makes every Pixel
release feel like an episode of "Deal or No Deal." Since the Nexus 5, I haven't
owned a non-Google phone.

I've been really lucky not to have broken any of those phones... Until now. If
you are a Pixel owner with an intact, unbroken phone, take my advice: don't
break it.

<!--more-->

My current phone is the Pixel 6 Pro, which I ordered on launch day to replace my
aging but perfectly serviceable Pixel 4 (I skipped the 5 because they
inexplicably dropped the fingerprint sensor; see what I mean about the drunken
stumbling?)

I started using it straight away in spite of not having a case for it yet. There
is more to say about how Google managed to sell a new phone with an official
case that wouldn't ship for another *month* after launch, but let's leave it at
"I couldn't get a case on day one."

I ordered a generic case and expected it within a couple of days, so I tried to
be careful, and I failed. It was a simple accident, and with a case I'm sure the
phone would have been fine, but I managed to break the glass covering the
cameras.

Again, there is more to say here about how breakable the glass covering the
cameras seems to be, at least compared to the Fruit Company's camera glass, but
this is not a scientific experiment it's just a story, so let's keep our eye on
the ball, shall we?

## Fixing a Google Pixel

If you are an owner of a Fruit Phone, and if you pay for the "FruitCare"
insurance plan, you can walk into any Fruit Company Store and receive some kind
of dispensation, whether a repair or a replacement. I have one close friend who
has received entirely new replacement phones under that plan more times than I
can actually count.

That's great because it's your *phone*; while you don't have it, you largely
can't be reached. Nowadays, you can't even get anywhere without your maps app of
choice, and that's a topic for another day, but here we are: we're quite lost
without these things (figuratively, at least), and nobody wants to send one out
for potentially *weeks* for repairs.

Google, however, doesn't have retail stores all around the world, so they did
what any reasonable multi-billion-dollar international corporation would do:
they partnered with a consumer electronics insurance company called
Asurion. Asurion operates a chain of shops called (I'm not making this up)
"uBreakiFix", which was founded in 2009 and has over 600 stores in the US and
Canada.

If you need some repair done on your Google Pixel and you live in the US, you
have exactly two choices: mail the phone to Google, or visit a uBreakiFix
location (if you can find one near you). I live in the Boston area, so I'm lucky
to have *two* uBreakiFix locations nearby, one just minutes from my house, so
that's what I chose to do.

## Where the Trouble Starts

If I had to "bottom line" the troubles I've had in getting my Pixel 6 Pro
repaired, I'd say it is all on account of Google's inability to execute this
repair relationship with Asurion/uBreakiFix, which includes not only
communicating expectations with the entire organization, but aligning parts
supply chains and ultimately overseeing the consumer experience (even
slightly).

The first time I contacted a nearby uBreakiFix location, I learned that they
didn't even have parts other than screens for Pixel 6 Pro phones (the phones
having been released just weeks prior), and the person I spoke to suspected that
for broken camera glass, they'd have to replace *the entire back* of the phone
and they didn't have any of those parts.

At this point, the camera worked, and it even worked surprisingly well
considering the cracks in front of it, so I chose to live with it and check back
in at some later date when more parts might be available.

Fast forward seven months, and I find myself talking to uBreakiFix about a
laptop battery replacement. That's another whole story, but my local shop did a
great job (and fast!) replacing the battery in my years-old MacBook Pro, so I
asked once again about the phone glass.

## The Trouble Escalates

A very nice guy at my local shop was confident the glass could be fixed. Upon
some investigation, we discovered that the camera glass piece itself is now
available, and can be replaced without touching the rest of the back of the
phone. He said he'd order the part and could do the replacement as soon as it
came in.

One thing that put me off about the process, and where I think Google is
seriously dropping the ball, is that this guy at the repair shop was literally
searching YouTube for how to replace this part, because evidently being Google's
"authorized repair partner" doesn't mean you get any sort of, I don't know,
*service manuals* or anything.

Moreover, they do have access to parts, but of course all of the Pixel phone
parts are ham-handedly smashed into Asurion's internal parts database with
sometimes inscrutable names like "camera carbon fiber sheet" and no separate
reference as to where the part is in the larger assembly or even a picture in
many cases.

About a week later, the camera glass piece came in, and I left my phone with
them to repair for the weirdest couple of hours during which I *listened to
terrestrial radio* in my car for the first time, um, ever.

I was so excited to pick up my newly fixed phone with pristine camera glass, it
would be *just like new*, it would be *finally whole again* after so many
months.

But as you'd expect by the section heading, my troubles were not over. Indeed,
the glass was fixed, hooray! But some tiny broken glass pieces and dust remained
inside, and the camera image revealed spots. That's bad enough, but the
autofocus also refused to work.

In short: my phone was now more broken than it was before.

## Blame Google

The guy who did the repair was *incredibly* apologetic, and he actually tried
two times to remove the glass again and clean it all out while I sat and
waited. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, it didn't work.

Now certainly there are criticisms that I could level against uBreakiFix here. I
don't know what training, if any, they are offering these techs. Considering the
YouTube searching I witnessed, and the mention of "checking eBay" for some
parts, I'd say they operate more like freelancers than employees of an
international insurance company authorized by the device manufacturer.

They're not doing these repairs in what you'd call a "clean room." There is a
glass partition between the storefront and the back room, with shapes etched
into it for privacy, but between the shapes it is easy to make out that each
employee has a desk where they do repairs and also eat their Lay's potato chips,
an open bag of which I could clearly make out.

While you may or may not choose to leave your device at any uBreakiFix you walk
into, Google's authorization of this chain is a stamp of approval from
them. This is Google saying aloud, "Go have your $1,000 Pixel 6 Pro repaired by
potato chip guy."

Expect this process to take weeks, because they'll have to order parts they
"think" might be the right ones, given no official reference, and they'll be
looking up how to do it on iFixit just like everyone else.

## Repair Is a Product Feature

Even in a world where we're being conditioned to believe that phones are
"[throwaway devices][throwaway]" and where "VIN locking" is rampant and has 
[likely killed people][medtronic], the ability to have an expensive device repaired,
even at great cost, through official channels *is* an expectation.

It's *irresponsible* of Google, a multi-billion-dollar international
corporation, to do such a half-assed job of Pixel repair after this many years
and iterations of Pixel phones. Full stop.

uBreakiFix has ordered an entire replacement camera module for my phone, and I'm
sure that the tech who messed up the glass repair is going to be extra careful
in replacing it for me, and I'll update this post when it's all over.

To be clear, I'm not blaming uBreakiFix, or even this specific tech for these
issues. Accidents happen in repair, and the job is tricky. But it's made
impossibly hard by the absence of official documentation, availability of parts,
and support for doing the job in the way that Google should want it to be
done. The whole situation reeks of corner-cutting in a way that Google is kind
of notorious for.

But what can I do? Get a Fruit Phone? That's a topic for another---much
longer---post, I think.
