My best friend is a guy I've known for over 20 years, since some time in high
school. He was best man in my wedding, and I was best man in his. We talk almost
every day, and we have worked in three different companies together.

In the last couple of years, he's been on a mission to take his daughter, who is
now 14, to every United States national park before she turns 18. That's a
really cool---and ambitious---goal in itself. But he isn't just doing it for
her; he is also a landscape photographer.

Landscape photography isn't his primary job, or a significant source of income
for him. He does it because he loves it, and he attacks it with almost unmatched
tenacity and endurance.

It might sound uncharitable to describe it as "obsession," but that's what it
is. I mean, according to the dictionary definition, he's obsessed.

I've never understood it.

I don't mean to come across as unappreciative or condescending here. I think
that my friend's mission and ambition are admirable, and what he's achieved so
far is remarkable. It's not that I don't understand how he can be committed to
what he's doing; I can, and I admire it, I might even envy it.

What I'm saying is that I *literally don't understand* how to sustain interest
in a single thing for that long. I have a couple of interests that have stuck
around (including photography and writing), but even with those, I'm hot and
cold over the days and years. I'll go *months* without taking a single photo.

There was a time when I was taking photography very seriously. Traveling, taking
thousands of photographs, printing and framing them, and
[writing about it constantly][ssp], but even within that broad interest, I
changed cameras, changed lenses, and became temporarily enamored with various
techniques like long exposures, light painting, and so on.

There has never been a time I can remember in my life where I was singularly
driven to do the same thing again and again.
