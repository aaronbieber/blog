This is the [Merriam-Webster definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/resource):

**reÂ·source**, *n.*

1. a source of supply or support: an available means---usually used in plural
2. a natural source of wealth or revenue---often used in plural
3. a natural feature or phenomenon that enhances the quality of human life
4. computable wealth---usually used in plural
5. a source of information or expertise

Huh, that's weird. Nowhere in there does it say "a human member of a team or
organization." So why do people insist on dehumanizing their colleagues by
referring to them as "a resource?"

<!--more-->

It all starts with *project management*.

The project management discipline teaches frameworks for understanding and
executing complex plans, and through that lens, it's easier to think of
humans abstractly, as "an available means" in the above definition. This
apparently caught on, and you'll witness others (mostly in leadership roles)
using the word "resource" to refer to a human being.

In the aggregate, abstractly, when talking about hypothetical plans or future
org structures, it makes some sense to group "our cloud-based architecture," and
"500 laptops," and "a team of 20 engineers," and "5 senior product managers"
together as so many *resources*.

But people aren't fungible, they aren't interchangeable, they aren't even
specifically measurable (a topic for another post).

Each human is unique, and even when hired to do the same specifically defined
job, they are unlike anyone else who does it, or anyone who will *ever* do it.

When you manage in the abstract and group people together as "an available
means," you *rob yourself of the value* of working with people. Not only is it
insulting and dehumanizing, it's *limiting*.

So stop calling people "resources."
