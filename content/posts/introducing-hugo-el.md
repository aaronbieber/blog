I promised more posts, and more posts you shall have. Indeed I have been a busy
little bee, and finally I have something to show for it.

When I was blogging frequently, using Octopress, one of the things I did
straight away was to write a wrapper for Emacs called `octopress.el`, which
provides an interactive interface to its basic functions and a few ergonomic
benefits like easy image and post URL insertion.

Since I decided to move away from Octopress onto Hugo, I missed having
that... So, I wrote one for Hugo. I call it `hugo.el`.

A package like this one exists on MELPA already. It is called `easy-hugo`, and I
did give it a try. It's OK, but it wasn't very intuitive for me and it felt like
it was trying to do too much.

I modeled `octopress.el` after the amazing, timeless Magit, and I followed the
same pattern with `hugo.el`. In fact, `hugo.el` is a fork of `octopress.el` for
all intents and purposes, though I did it all manually.

The vast majority of the code is copied from the other package, with instances
of `octopress` and `jekyll` replaced with `hugo`, but I took the time to move
each block of functionality separately by hand to ensure that it all hangs
together properly.

There's plenty more that can be done, but it's in a workable state and I'll
probably work on writing a nice `README` and try to get it into MELPA soon.

For now, you can view the spartan repository such as it is: 
[Hugo.el on GitHub](https://github.com/aaronbieber/hugo.el).
