"So, what do you do?"

Maybe you've asked someone this question when meeting them for the first time. A
friend of a friend, or a stranger on a plane, or your date. It's a "safe"
question to break the ice; after all, everyone has a job, right?

Sure, but why do we let our jobs *define us?* Why do we love work so much?

Why, when we meet someone for the first time, do we jump straight to *How do you
generate economic value?* Why do people who've lost their jobs feel shame,
self-hatred, and depression? Why is our "personal fulfillment, social inclusion,
and respectability," [as described][vallas] by Northeastern sociology professor Steven
Vallas, so tied up in our employment?

All this while we, as a country, [work more hours][hours] than most other
industrialized nations, glorify work in our laws and norms, and have 
[marginal gains to show for it][gdp]. Netherlands enjoys 91% of the United States'
per-capita GDP (according to the CIA circa 2019) and yet everyone there receives
a statutory minimum of *four times hours worked* of paid leave (or 20 days for
40-hour workers) and *sixteen weeks* of paid parental leave.

For reference, the United States has a statutory minimum leave of... What was it
exactly? Oh yeah, **zero hours**. For **everyone**.

As an aside, per-capita GDP is hardly an ideal proxy for value of work, since
the vast majority of value created in America flows to the top couple percent of
earners, and therefore the distributions of effort put into the system and value
extracted from the system are vastly different. Still, on the whole, we work
harder for the value we create than others.

As you likely know, Americans used to work even more than we do today. The
five-day work week didn't gain broad popularity until the late '20s, and up
until then everyone worked at least six days a week. We only got Sundays off
because the one thing business leaders considered to be of higher importance
than profit was *church*.

Among the unplanned experiments run by American businesses during the COVID-19
pandemic, moving to a four-day work week was one. 
[This piece in The Atlantic][atlantic] follows a couple of American companies
that temporarily or permanently adopted a four-day week and what their outcomes
were. Spoiler alert: the companies are fine.

A woman I worked with years ago, who was in a director-level role in a large
corporation, once quipped "There's always more work to do." What these
experiments and decades of observations show is what we've known all along: work
expands to fill all available hours, and not all of those hours are consumed by
*actual work*.

So why do we kill ourselves with stress, endure arduous daily commutes, and feel
guilty muting email notifications on vacation? Why do we, as a society,
[celebrate "busyness"][busy] and glorify "the grind?" Why have we built a
multi-billion-dollar startup culture obsessed with "hustle," to the point that
millennials became known as "[the burnout generation?][burnout]"

How is [selling boutique luggage][luggage] worth being bullied and overworked by
privileged entrepreneurs? Why should an extra few bucks be worth [driving for Lyft *while literally in labor*][lyft]?

What is any of this doing for us individually or collectively?

Maybe what we need is to embrace the old adage, *work smarter, not
harder*. Prioritize ruthlessly, invest in *adding leverage* instead of adding
toil, and stop shaming each other for taking care of ourselves, because if our
bodies fall apart from disuse and stress, what good can come of that?
