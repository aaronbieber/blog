# The Chronicle

*of a ColdFusion Expatriate*

This is the source code of my personal, (mostly) technical blog, which is
converted into a static website by Hugo.

I painstakingly converted this site design and content over from the previous
version, which used Octopress/Jekyll (and that version was painstakingly
converted from WordPress). As a result, it isn't quite as simple and clean under
the covers as I'd like, but it works.

In particular, I'm still rolling in all of the Compass core Sass, with a couple
of modifications to excise custom functions that are implemented in Compass. I'm
probably using 1% of Compass, but because the site's theme was based on it, it's
like a house of cards now, until some day when I get fed up and basically try to
rewrite it. That day is not today.

There isn't much else that is unique about this Hugo site, though, and it should
compile using regular old Hugo, as long as it's version 0.60 or higher (the
version I created it with).
